# gas mix id, 12 is He_0.2-DME_0.8 
gas_id:12

# gas pressure (atm)
pressure:1.

# cell thickness (cm)
thickness:1

# energy, only energy_min used right now
energy_min:11.0
energy_max:11.0

# polarization angle and degree
pol_angle:30.
pol_degree:1.

# source + window non selectable for now

# number of event to be simulated or read from file (-1 for all)
num_evts:-1

# input file path : 'None' to run a standard MC
